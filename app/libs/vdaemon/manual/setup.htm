  VDaemon Setup</h1>
<p>Before you start using VDaemon you need to setup it properly.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>VDaemon comes in zip archive &quot;vdaemon.zip&quot;. To install VDaemon unpack it to any folder under web site root on
your web server. <SPAN class=postbody>VDaemon files must be accessible from the internet.</SPAN> It's
recommended to unpack it into &quot;&lt;website_root&gt;/vdaemon&quot; folder.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>VDaemon configuration options are located in the <b>config.php</b> file in VDaemon installation
  folder:</p>
<p><b>$sVDaemonSecurityKey</b> - this key is used by VDaemon to prevent form validation rules from <SPAN class=postbody>changing
     or avoiding by person
    with malicious intentions</SPAN>. While
  this key kept secret <SPAN class=postbody>you can be sure that your validation rules are genuine.
  It is strongly recomended to change this key after installation. Do not use common words for this. This key is
  not a password - you do not need to memorize it and can change it at any time. So, values like &quot;kjgdf69maluhjltr6qt154vic&quot;
  is exactly what you need. It can be of any length (but more than 10 characters is recomended). </SPAN></p>
<p><b>VDAEMON_POST_SECURITY</b> - defines VDaemon's behavior on action page in case of POST request. If form data
has been sent using POST method but validation data of the form is missing then there is a risk that your
  form is under attack - someone tries to avoid validation process. In this case VDaemon behavior depends on VDAEMON_POST_SECURITY
    option. If VDAEMON_POST_SECURITY is true then VDaemon will generate error and stop, otherwise VDaemon will skip
    validation.
  You can set this option for each specific page (&quot;define&quot; statement should be placed before VDaemon
&quot;include&quot; like shown below):</p>
<p>define('VDAEMON_POST_SECURITY', false);<br>
  include('vdaemon'php');</p>
<p><b>VDAEMON_USE_BUNDLED_PEAR</b> - defines which PEAR.php file will be used by VDaemon. VDaemon uses XML_HTMLSax
  PEAR package to parse html pages. This package comes with VDaemon installation. This allows VDaemon to work if
  PEAR is not installed or not configured properly on your web server, but it can cause a conflict between PEAR packages.</p>
<p>If VDAEMON_USE_BUNDLED_PEAR option is set to &quot;true&quot; then VDaemon will use bundled PEAR package (comes with
  VDaemon)<br>
  If VDAEMON_USE_BUNDLED_PEAR option is set to &quot;false&quot; then VDaemon will try to find PEAR installation
on web server and use PEAR from there. If it will not be found VDaemon will use bundled PEAR package.</p>
<p>You must set this option to &quot;false&quot; if you plan to use other PEAR functionality and VDaemon simultaneously.</p>
<p><b>VDAEMON_SIMULATE_SELFSUBMIT</b> - if set to &quot;true&quot; VDaemon simulates selfsubmit form
	behavior. I.e. in case of errors you will have post variables available on the form page.<br>
  Note: you always 
  can get post variables from $_VDAEMON global array. </p>
<p><b>VDAEMON_SAVE_DATA</b> - defines whether VDaemon must save submitted forms data to a session.</p>
