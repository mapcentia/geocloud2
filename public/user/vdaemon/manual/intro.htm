<h1><span class="section">VDaemon User Guide</span><br>
  Introduction</h1>
<p>An important aspect of creating Web Forms pages for user input is to be able to check that
  the information users enter is valid. VDaemon is a PHP library that grants an easy-to-use  
   but powerful way to check for errors and, if necessary, display messages to the user. VDaemon
   provides several custom HTML tags (VDaemon tags) to allow developer defining form validation
   rules.</p>
<p>VDaemon provides a mechanism for all common types of validation - for example, testing 
  for valid dates or values within a specified range - plus ways to provide custom-written validation. 
  In addition, VDaemon allows for complete customization of how error information is displayed 
  to the user.</p>
<h2>Using VDaemon tags<a name="Using"></a></h2>
<p>You enable validation of user input by adding VDaemon tags to your form as you would with
   other HTML tags. Each VDaemon validation tag (validator) references an input tag on the
  form. When the user's input is processed (for example, when the form is submitted), VDaemon
  tests the user's input and sets a state to indicate whether the entry passed the validation test(s).
  If any of the validation tests fail, the entire form is set to invalid.</p>
<p>You can test the state of a form using your own (custom) code. For example, you can test
  the state  of a form for properly formatted and required information before updating a database
  with the submitted information.
  If you detect an invalid state, you bypass the database update. Typically, if any validation
  check fails, user is returned to the form
  page  with error messages that you have predefined for VDaemon to display in the
  event of validation failure. These
  error messages will help to guide and prompt the user
  to enter the required and/or properly formatted information.</p>
<h2>Validating for Multiple Conditions<a name="Multiple"></a></h2>
<p>Each VDaemon validator performs just one test. However, you may wish to check 
  an input element for multiple conditions. For example, you might want to establish that a
  field is required and that it is limited to accepting dates within a specific range. You
  can have
  more than 
  one validation tag reference a given input field in a form. In that case, the tests performed
  by the validators are resolved using a logical AND. The data input by the user must
  pass all the tests 
  in order to be considered valid.</p>
<p>In some instances, entries in several different formats might be valid. For example, if
  you are prompting for a phone number, you might allow users to enter a local number, a long-distance
  number, or an international number. This situation arises primarily when checking for specific
  patterns of numbers or characters. To perform this type of test &#8212; a logical OR &#8212; you
use the group validator  and specify multiple validators within it.</p>
<h2>Displaying Error Information<a name="Error"></a></h2>
<p>Validators are not visible in the rendered form. However, if the validator detects
   an error, it produces error message text that you specify. The error message can be displayed
  
  in a variety of ways: </p>
<h4>- In place</h4>
<p>Each validator can be referenced by a VDaemon label. VDaemon label displays an error message
  or glyph in place (usually next to the control where the error occurred).</p>
<h4>- Summary</h4>
<p>Validation errors can be collected and displayed in one place - for example, at the top of 
  the form. This strategy is often used in combination with displaying a glyph next to the input 
  fields with errors. </p>
<h4>- In place and Summary</h4>
<p>The error message can be different in the summary and in place. You can use this option to 
  show a shorter error message in place with more detail in the summary, or to show an error 
  glyph next to the input field and an error message in the summary.</p>
