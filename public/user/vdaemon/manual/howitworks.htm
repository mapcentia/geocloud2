  How VDaemon works</h1>
<p>VDaemon can perform server side and client side validation. Client side (javascript) validation
  is optional and can be turned off (default is on). VDaemon performs validation on the server even if the validation have
  already performed on the client. It helps prevent users from being able to bypass
  validation by disabling or changing the client script.</p>
<h2>Server-Side Validation </h2>
<p><img src="../img/scheme.gif" width="478" height="171"></p>
<p>When the user submits a form to the server, VDaemon code is invoked to review the user's
  input. If an error has occurred in any of the input controls, the page
  itself is set to
an invalid state (validation failed) and user is redirected back to the form page with displayed
  error messages. If validation passed, user code specified on form processing page is invoked.
  Thus, VDaemon doesn't change HTML forms behavior except it always redirects visitor to the
  form page until visitor enters fully valid data. It allows easily incorporate VDaemon validation
  into existing web sites.</p>
<h2>Client-Side Validation</h2>
<p>If the user is working with browser that support DHTML and W3C DOM Level2, VDaemon can
  perform validation using client script. Because in this case immediate
  feedback
  is provided (without
a round trip to the server), the user experience with the page is enhanced.</p>
<p>Under most circumstances,
    you do not have to make any changes to your page or to the validators to use client-side
    validation. VDaemon automatically detects if the browser supports
    DHTML
    and performs its checking accordingly. Client-side validation uses the same
  error display mechanism as server-side checking.</p>
<p>Currently client-side validation is tested for  IE
&gt;= 5, Firefox &gt;= 1.0, Netscape &gt;= 7, Opera &gt;= 7, Safari &gt;= 2.0.</p>
